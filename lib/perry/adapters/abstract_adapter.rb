# = Perry::Adapters::AbstractAdapter
#
# This is the base class from which all adapters should inherit from.  Subclasses should overwrite
# one or all of read, write, and/or delete.  They should also register themselves with a
# unique name using the register_as class method.
#
# Adapters contain a stack of code that is executed on each request.  Here is a diagram of the basic
# anatomy of the adaper stack:
#
#   +----------------+
#   |   Perry::Base  |
#   +----------------+
#           |
#   +----------------+
#   |   Processors   |
#   +----------------+
#           |
#   +----------------+
#   |   ModelBridge  |
#   +----------------+
#           |
#   +----------------+
#   |   Middlewares  |
#   +----------------+
#           |
#   +----------------+
#   |     Adapter    |
#   +----------------+
#
# Each request is routed through registred processors, the ModelBridge, and registered middlewares
# before reaching the adapter.  After the adapter does its operation the return value passes through
# each item in the stack allowing stack items to do both custom pre and post processing to every
# request.
#
# == Configuration
#
# You can configure your adapters using the configure method on Perry::Base
#
#   configure(:read) do |config|
#     config.adapter_var_1 = :custom_value
#     config.adapter_var_2 = [:some, :values]
#   end
#
# This block creates a new configuration context.  Each context is merged onto the previous context
# allowing subclasses to override configuration set by their parent class.
#
# == Middlewares
#
# Middlewares allow you to add custom logic between the model and the adapter.  A good example is
# caching.  A caching middleware could be implemented that intercepted a request to the adapter and
# returned the cached value for that request.  If the request is a cache miss it could pass the
# request on to the adapter, and then cache the result for subsequent calls of the same request.
#
# This is an example mof a no-op middleware:
#
#   class NoOpMiddleware
#
#     def initialize(adapter, config={})
#       @adapter = adapter
#       @config = config
#     end
#
#     def call(options)
#       @adapter.call(options)
#     end
#
#   end
#
# Though this doesn't do anything it serves to demonstrate the basic structure of a middleware.
# Logic could be added to perform caching, custom querying, or custom result processing.
#
# Middlewares can also be chained to perform several independent actions.  Middlewares are configured
# through a custom configuration method:
#
#   configure(:read) do |config|
#     config.add_middleware(MyMiddleware, :config => 'var', :foo => 'bar')
#   end
#
# == ModelBridge
#
# The ModelBridge is simply a middleware that is always installed.  It instantiates the records from
# the data returned by the adapter.  It "bridges" the raw data to the mapped object.
#
# == Processors
#
# Much like middlewares, processors allow you to insert logic into the request stack.  The
# differentiation is that processors are able to manipulate the instantiated objects rather than
# just the raw data.  Processors have access to the objects immediately before passing the data back
# to the model space.
#
# The interface for a processor is identical to that of a middleware.  The return value of the call
# to adapter; however, is an array of Perry::Base objects rather than Hashes of attributes.
#
# Configuration is also very similar to middlewares:
#
#   configure(:read) do |config|
#     config.add_processor(MyProcessor, :config => 'var', :foo => 'bar')
#   end
#
#
